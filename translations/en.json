<b> to get the maximum of curatorial rewards from your votes - we recommend to take votes or make weight to smaller if the post is spam, copy-paste, or which you like less than others </b>

<b> In the current version of the bot appeared the ability to specify two weight values:</b>

"For favorites" - the power of the voice with which you will vote for the posts of your favorite authors.
"For repeat" - the power of the voice with which you will vote during the replay of votes for your curator.

During the work you will see behind which curator the voice repeats. We recommend removing the curators from the list if they vote for low-quality content!
